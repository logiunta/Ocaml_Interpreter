# Ocaml_Interpreter

The project consists in the design and implementation of some software modules.
Consider an extension of the functional didactic language (Code_Ocaml.txt) that allows you to manipulate dictionaries. A dictionary is a collection of values uniquely identified by a key. Therefore, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where the key is unique.

There are two implementation of the Interpreter: one with dynamic type checking, and one with static type checking
